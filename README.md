# PQDiSE-from-PQDPRF
PQDPRF stands for post-quantum secure distributed PRF (Pseudo Random Function), constructed from quantum-safe LWR (Learning with Rounding) assumption. Furthermore, efficacy of this DPRF is shown by using it in construction of post-quantum secure distributed symmetric key encryption (abbreviated as, PQDiSE).
